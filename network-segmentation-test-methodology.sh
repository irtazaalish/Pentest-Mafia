analyze the network diagram to define PCI in-scope and out-of-scope 

ICMP scan: 
    sudo nmap -T 5 -sP -oA init-ping_sweep -iL hosts.txt (or put IPs: 10.130.1.1-50)

tcp scan:
    sudo nmap -sV -p- -T4 -v -v -oA nmap/tcpbatch1intoout -Pn -iL hosts.txt (or put IPs: 10.130.1.1-50)
    sudo nmap -sV -p- -T4 -v -v -sS -oA nmap/tcpbatch1intoout -Pn -iL hosts.txt (or put IPs: 10.130.1.1-50)
    sudo nmap -sV -p- -T4 -v -v -sT -oA nmap/tcpbatch1intoout -Pn -iL hosts.txt (or put IPs: 10.130.1.1-50)

Udp Scan:
    sudo nmap -sU -sV -T4 -v -n -Pn â€“top-ports 10000 -oA nmap/udpbatch1intoout -iL hosts.txt (or put IPs: 10.130.1.1-50)

-n/-R: Never do DNS resolution/always resolve

note:
    scan from in-scope to out-of-scope and vice versa
    scan all 65535 ports 
    scan in host batches (i.e every 50 hosts)
    depending on network bandwith, scan in port batches (i.e every 10000 ports)
    All ports should be either closed or filtered while performing the scan from PCI in-scope to PCI out-of-scope and vice versa.
    if get open|filtered check manually: (nc ip port)
    if all ports al returned as filetred check some common random ports: (nc ip port)
    if the scan is taking very long try: ( sudo nmap -p- -T5 -v -v -oA tcpbatch1 -Pn -iL hosts.txt (or put IPs: 10.130.1.1-50))
